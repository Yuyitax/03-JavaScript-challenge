# The JavaScript Password Generator Challenge

## About the Project

In this project you will be able to appreciate an application that generates random passwords with a length between 8 and 128 characters. The password is personalized according to the user's criteria. 


Every detail of the functions and changes have a comment inside my code. Please refer to the scrip.js file in order to view these comments. [script.js](./assets/script.js)
